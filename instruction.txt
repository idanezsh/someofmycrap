How To Use 
Download the script. Insure that you have the proper path to python in the script. Currently, it is set to '#!/usr/bin/python' (where RedHat installs it), you may need to change that to '#!/usr/local/bin/python' if that is where you have it. Be sure to do a 'chmod +x ./mailRemove.py' on the script so that unix will execute it. 
Become a privileged user. Become root or whatever user you need to be to manipulate the queue files. 
Stop qmail. Any program that works on the qmail queue's will need to do this. qmail cannot deal with programs manipulating the queue while it is running. 
Create a /var/qmail/queue/filter directory. This is where the filtered email will go. 
Run the script as a test run. 
For example, this would scan for emails that had the words 'annacsfun' or 'puyals98' in ANY part of the emails.
./mailRemove.py annacsfun puyals98

Run the script, FOR REAL, 
./mailRemove.py --real annacsfun puyals98

Start qmail again. You are done.
